<p>You might be wondering why a website created for an ODU CS class is collecting cookies. Maybe you're not. Well
    if you're not, why did you wonder on to this page? That doesn't make much sense now does it. That being said,
    I'll assume you are curious as to what I'm doing with that information. Honestly, I'm not doing anything. I
    just wanted to see if I added this page if you'd navigate to it. Looks like you did, so good for you.</p>

    <h3>1. What Data Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?</h3>
    Personally Identifiable Information We may collect Personally Identifiable Information that either directly identifies you or could reasonably be used in combination with other publicly available information to identify you. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information include your name, contact information, email address, and other information in combination with such identifiers.
    Certain areas of our websites and online resources allow you to submit your Personally");
            WriteLiteral(@" Identifiable Information to us. We may use the information you provide to send you requested information, respond to your inquiry, improve our website, verify your relationship with us, and take other actions that may be necessary to respond to your request.
    Where permitted by law, we may combine the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with other information you share with us through this website. Where permitted by law, we may also combine Personally Identifiable Information collected through our website and online resources with the Final Solution’s offline records and information provided by third parties. We use this consolidated information to improve our website and online resources, enhance our marketing activities, better design our offerings, and to facilitate other business functions.
    Other Information
    Our website and other online resources also collect other basic information about you which does not directly identify you but which may correspond with you or a particular");
            WriteLiteral(@" device. We use this information to learn more about how our website and online resources are used and to otherwise improve and administer the site. We also use this information to enable us to deliver information tailored to your interests and preferences, based on your use of the site. For example, we may collect the Internet Protocol address assigned to your computer by your internet service provider. This address may change each time you connect to the internet (a “dynamic” IP address) or it may remain the same (a “static” IP address.)
    To collect basic information, we use the techniques described below:
    Cookies. Our website may use a tracking technology called a “cookie.” A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive, where your internet browser files are kept. Cookies enable a site to “remember” the information a visitor has previously inputted, or in some cases, certain other sites that the user has visited. Cookies may be placed on your computer both by ");
            WriteLiteral(@"us and by third parties with whom we have a relationship, such as web analytic services and advertising network services. Further information concerning the use of third-party cookies on our site can be found below, in the section titled Our Policy on Cookies and other Tracking Technologies.
    Web Beacons. On certain web pages or in emails we send to you, we may utilize a technology called a “web beacon” (also known as an “action tag” or “clear GIF technology”). We may use web beacons to help determine which email messages sent by us were opened and whether a message was acted upon. Web beacons also help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.
    Social Plugins.
    This site may use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our site, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a cookie on your computer, enabling that");
            WriteLiteral(@" operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our site. If you are logged into the associated social media website (e.g., Facebook) before browsing on our website, the social plugin allows that social media website to receive information about your visit to particular pages on our website. The social plugin may collect this information for any such visitors who have logged into social networks, whether or not they specifically interact with the plugin on our website (e.g., by clicking “Like” or “Share”). The social plugin may also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on our website with other users of their social media website. For more information about the information shared via a particular social media plugin, you should refer to that social media site’s privacy statement.
    <h3>2. Does This CS312 Project Disclose Your Information to Third Parties?</h3>
    We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose the information we collect through our website");
            WriteLiteral(@"s, except as provided in this policy. We may disclose information to third parties who provide us with various business services, including monitoring and maintaining the website and preparing newsletters and mailings. We may also share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties with whom we are working to provide you with services or information.
    We may also disclose information we collect in special cases, including when we have a reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring a legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our rights and property or those of any other person. We may also disclose information when we believe the law requires it and in any situation that involves threats to any person’s physical safety.
    If all or part of the Final Solution is merged into another entity, the information we have about you may be transferred to a third party as part of that transaction. We will try to assure that no Person");
            WriteLiteral(@"ally Identifiable Information that is transferred will be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with this policy without your consent. Your information may also be included among the assets affected by financing agreements undertaken by the Final Solution. Your continued use of this website would, however, signify your agreement to be bound by the privacy statement and other applicable terms of the subsequent owner or operator.
    <h3>3. Will the Final Solution Transfer Your Information Internationally?</h3>
    Our website and online resources are owned and operated in the United States, but the information you provide may be accessible by our affiliates and vendors in other countries. If you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your information will cross an international boundary. The level of protection for your information in the United States may not be the same as the level of protection in your country. By using this site, you consent to the collection, storage, and");
            WriteLiteral(@" processing of your information in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.
    <h3>4. Is the Website Intended for Children?</h3>
    Our website and online resources are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13 years of age. However, if the parent or the guardian of a child has reason to believe that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, the parent or guardian of that child should Contact Us to request deletion of this data from our files. Anyone under 18 years old should seek their parent’s or guardian’s permission prior to using or disclosing any Personally Identifiable Information to the Final Solution.
    <h3>5. Is the Final Solution Responsible For The Websites It Links To?</h3>
    We are not. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the content of third-party websites or resources, and our privacy policy ");
            WriteLiteral(@"does not apply to any sites that are not affiliated with the Final Solution, even if you access them via a link on our site. You should review the privacy policies of any third-party site before providing any information.
    <h3>6. What Else Do You Need to Know?</h3>
    We reserve the right to amend this policy at our discretion. When changes are made, we will be post the updated policy and the date of the revision. By continuing to use the the Final Solution web site after the posting of such changes, you accept the Policy as modified.
    Our Policy on Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
    Cookies save you the trouble of reentering certain information in some registration areas, help to deliver content-specific information to you, and track which sections of the site are most popular. A “cookie” is actually a file that our web server or the web server of one of our third-party partners may send to your computer when you access one of our sites. This file is then stored on your computer.
    Why");
            WriteLiteral(@" do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
    As mentioned in our policy above, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for a number of purposes. For example, we may use cookies to “remember” information you have entered on our site, like your email login to your the Final Solution account. We may use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the information we supply to you and other users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

    Certain web browsers and other programs may be used to signal your preferences to the Final Solution about how or whether the Final Solution or third parties may collect information about your online activities. Currently, our websites and online resources do not respond to such signals.
